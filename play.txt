RULES:

You take turns to drop a counter. You do this by entering the column you want to drop into. One player plays as X counters and the other as O.

In order to win, you need to get four of your counters in a row. They can be placed in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. You can play as long as you want. 


HAVE FUN !!!!!!!!
